How to do a Github Release

Running debuild sets the version in CMakeLists.txt from the one in 
debian/changelog. This then has to be commited.

To do a Github release that triggers the debuild action you have to create a
version tag v<version>. This version must match the version in first line of 
the debian/changelog. The tag must have a v prefix.

So as a step by step guide this is:
1. Make a debian/changelog entry for the new version. This can be done with
   dch -v <version>.
2. Run debuild followed by add -u; commit -m "v<version>" and bring that 
   commit into the master branch.
3. Create a tag v<version> in Github.
4. Create a release from that tag. The release action that is triggered will 
   create the packages and upload them to the cloudsmith repo. This will take
   about an hour.
