Feel free to implement support your own hardware ;)

Installation
---------------
To install, follow the detailed installation instructions at http://wiki.volkszaehler.org/software/controller/vzlogger/installation_cpp-version

If you're impatient you can quickstart using (Debian Bullseye or Ubuntu 18.04 LTS):

    sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core cmake pkg-config subversion libcurl3-dev \
      libgnutls-dev libsasl2-dev uuid-dev uuid-runtime libtool dh-autoreconf libunistring-dev

If you want to use MQTT support:

    sudo apt-get install libmosquitto-dev

Then run the installation:

    wget https://raw.github.com/volkszaehler/vzlogger/master/install.sh
    sudo bash install.sh
    
Docker
------

You can also build a docker image:

     docker build -t vzlogger .
     
Note, that this will use the newest vzlogger from volkszaehler github (not your local clone).
You can start it:

     docker run --restart=always -v /home/pi/projects/vzlogger-docker:/cfg \
     --device=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT230X_Basic_UART_D30A9U5N-if00-port0 \
     --name vzlogger -d vzlogger

where /home/pi/projects/vzlogger-docker is the path to the directory containing the vzlogger.conf file and
/dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT230X_Basic_UART_D30A8U6N-if00-port0 is your device. You can pass several devices if you have them.

Debian and Raspbian Packages
-------------

[![Hosted By: Cloudsmith](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSS%20hosting%20by-cloudsmith-blue?logo=cloudsmith&style=flat-square)](https://cloudsmith.com)

We now build Debian packages for amd64, armhf and arm64 and Raspbian packages 
for armhf as part of our releases. Unfortunately Debian armhf packages do not 
run on Raspberry Pi 1 although the architecture on the RPi is named armhf. 
Using Raspian armhf packages fixes that.

The ones attached to the release are meant for debian trixie. These and 
packages for bookworm and bullseye are also provided through a repository 
graciously provided by [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com).

Those debian packages are built with MQTT support.

The setup of the repository is also 
[explained by Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~volkszaehler/repos/volkszaehler-org-project/setup/#formats-deb).
This boils down to adding a file to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ containing
```
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/volkszaehler-volkszaehler-org-project-archive-keyring.gpg] https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/volkszaehler/volkszaehler-org-project/deb/debian bookworm main
deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/volkszaehler-volkszaehler-org-project-archive-keyring.gpg] https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/volkszaehler/volkszaehler-org-project/deb/debian bookworm main
```
You need to replace bookworm with your distro and debian with raspbian in case
you are using an RPi 1. You also need to retrieve our repository key as a 
trusted one. 
```
curl -1sLf "https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/volkszaehler/volkszaehler-org-project/gpg.21DBDAC56DF44DA1.key" | \
	gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/volkszaehler-volkszaehler-org-project-archive-keyring.gpg
```
